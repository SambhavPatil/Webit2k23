Webbit 2k23 round 1 (SambhavPatil)

Problem statement:
There were many coders and programmers at a college who were passionate about technology and wanted to improve their skills. They would often work on coding projects on their own, but they felt that there was a need for a platform that could bring them together and help them collaborate. So you decided to start GeekforGeek Student Chapter. Where students can organize coding challenges, workshops, and events to help themselves and others improve their coding skills.
